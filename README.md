  # Project Description
This is a display of all of my past works, the main page takes you through my about me, there's also a contact page to get in contact with me, as well as my Portfolio page.

## Description 
The goal for this was to create a page that would be reactive to the type of device a user is viewing the webpage from.  This way it fits on all screen sizes without issue.  The layering of items would then collapse ontop of each other to create an easy to read streamline design for my portfolio.
